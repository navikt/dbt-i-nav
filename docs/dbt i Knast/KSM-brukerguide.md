# Secret handling in KNAST (Knast Secret Manager)
- KSM is a tool to use database (only Datavarehus oracle DBs P, U and R) password or secrets in a secure manner. This tool is available on "DBT (Data Build tool)" Knast-image.
- KSM saves encrypted secrets on Google Secret Manager (not on users disk) in users team project which only can be decrypted by a key (master password) generated by user during encryption process. Other team members can only see an encryoted JSON string in GCP team project.
- KSM provides the functionality to automatically integrate DB passwords/secrets required in DBT project, without user needing to provide DB passwords manually.
- If user forgets master password, KSM provides functionality (run "KSM-encrypt-secrets") to regenerate secrets which overwrites previous secrets on Google Secret Manager.


# 🚀 Installation

# ⚙️ One-time System Setup
> **⚠️ IMPORTANT:** Run these commands inside your **KNAST terminal**

### Step 1: 🔐 Authenticate with Google Cloud
```bash
gcloud auth login --update-adc
```
**Check if project is set**
```bash
gcloud config get-value project
```
**If project is not set: (enter google cloud project ID where you want to keep encrypt secrets)**
```bash
gcloud config set project <your-project-id>
```

### Step 2: 🔒 Enter & encrypt database(DVH) passwords 

#### Encrypt Secrets
```bash
KSM-encrypt-secrets
```

**What happens next:**
**Follow instructions in terminal**
1. 🔑 Terminal will prompt you to **choose DVH env & enter database password** and **create a master password** (a secure, memorable password you'll use daily to decrypt your database passwords.)
2. Terminal will prompt you to **choose or enter your preffered Google Cloud Project** to publish the secrets on Google Secret Manager. ⚠️ **Remember:** Always use **project ID** instead of project name.

> ⚠️ **CRITICAL:** Remember your master password; Keep it safe - **no recovery possible**

#### Check if script has created the secret in preferred GCP project:
1. Go to your Google Cloud Console
2. Go to **Security >> Secret Manager**
3. Under **Secrets** tab you will a list of secrets owned by you or your team
4. Choose your secret (with your **hostname** f.eks. a123456)
5. Under **Actions**, click **3 vertical dots** and choose **View secret value** to confirm secret. The same secret JSON should be printed out in your Knast terminal.


# 🎯 Per-repository setup
> **⚠️ IMPORTANT:** Go to your workdirectory/home directory (f.eks. `/home/user`) in the Terminal

### Step 1: Clone your dbt-project repo/ or Create new dbt project

### Step 2: 🐍 Create/activate Virtual environment

### Step 3: ⚙️ Initialize Repository
```bash
repo-init
```
**What repo-init does:**
- ✅ Places .pth file in venv for Python auto-loading
- ✅ Verifies cryptography availability
- ✅ Cleans up stale artifacts safely

### Step 4: 📋 Install Dependencies

**For requirements.txt:**
```bash
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**For pyproject.toml:**
```bash
uv pip install -r pyproject.toml
```

***
# ☀️ Daily Routine (Every Workstation Start or as needed)
> **🔄 Quick Start:** Run these commands at the beginning of each session within your repo

### Step 1: 🔐 Activate virtual environment


### Step 2: 🔐 Authenticate with GCP
```bash
gauth  # GCP authentication
```

### Step 3: 🔑 Set Master Password
```bash
mpass-set
```

### Step 4: ✅ Verify Setup (inside repo)
```bash
repo-status  # Tests if everything is okay
```
**This command tests:**
- ✅ Shell integration
- ✅ Master password caching
- ✅ Current GCP user & project ID
- ✅ Authentication details (token + ADC)

# 🎉 You are all set to work on your dbt project with DVH as source!
